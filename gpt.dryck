*Fun things to do in London:*

1. Try to walk away from the London skyline, which looks like an apocalyptic landscape.
2. Visit a place where you may find your mother-in-law, as well as an adorable dog with a tiny mouth.
3. Just go to sleep and dream dreams.
4. Eat dinner with friends, like one in London named Posh Pots.
5. Buy chocolate, as you always do here in London.

For the rest of us out there, you should probably stay on the internet as long as you can, as the internet can be filled with people talking about what’s best for you.

*Videogames cannot be art because* art cannot be art.

A good example of artwork not being art involves the famous photograph of two young women at an outdoor party. No artwork can be displayed at this party as it is too dangerous, but it does display the image of a young girl without clothing and a pair of breasts holding a knife at the same time.

The reason is because neither the photographer nor the photographer’s client has a clear understanding of what art is, or how it can be applied to artistic objects. A better example of artwork not being art would be something like the original painting of a Greek God by Carabellino.

Artists do not consider that this image is art because it is too good; it is too good.

One of the commonest statements of why a painting is not a piece of art is that it is of no artistic value. A great painter can be said to be a terrible artist (see: Monet); the best art never gets published.

Of course, there may be instances of good or artistic content in art that a viewer does not notice in the image. To illustrate, there is an example of a perfectly good painting that is just of art worth a painting. It is called a Picasso.

*Mr. President, I am writing to you today to* request an immediate briefing regarding concerns raised by my staff regarding a forthcoming event organized by the U.S. Embassy at the Russian Consulate in Chicago.

I understand that the U.S. Embassy will host several prominent political figure-slaying clown bands at its upcoming June 22 event at the Embassy’s Washington Park facility. The Embassy, however, is concerned about the event going forward because of concerns raised by our employees and the local community about the possibility of political violence from the various clown bands.

The fact is that such an event is not in our best interests.

The Embassy supports the right of individuals to express themselves freely in their neighborhoods. However, given our concerns regarding such clown bands and other political performers in Chicago, the Embassy cannot stand by idly while local residents engage in dangerous acts of violence on behalf of political clowns. The Embassy’s understanding is that the upcoming visit to the U.S. by representatives of “Mr. Trump” will likely include an event scheduled with the participation of the aforementioned clowns, who represent our political leader. In the event of such an event taking place, the Embassy believes it would be helpful to learn more about these clowns and hear from one of their agents.

Sincerely yours,

John Podesta.

*Let us go then, you and I, when the evening is spread out against the sky like a patient etherized upon a table*
whose surface lies under an open roof. I cannot tell if I do not have something of yours but I must tell you about me,
if it is not yet too late. I would tell you that the world knows me; the world understands me, and in that sense I am quite a good man and that there is nothing in the world for which I would like to die but those things which are the most pleasant to me. The man of peace and good faith looks on as I walk through the world. But the man of strife, the man of ill, the man of folly, the man of hatred – I look upon my existence with what would destroy it. I see that my life lies in the hands of others. But those are not true men; the man of peace and good faith is a man of violence; for if I do not kill myself, then the world will not find out about it and will treat it as something which it really is. I am a good man – I am very proud, even in spite of my wicked heart – but at the same time I cannot see that I am good.

*Welcome to Dota. You* do not like Dota. You may love it, not like it, and want to tell my ass how stupid you are for not liking Dota, but you don’t like Dota. You want to do something else? Do something else.

This isn’t to say you should just go for what you like, or that Dota is no good for you. We’re trying to create an opportunity to improve yourself, and Dota is absolutely important for that. There have been players of both styles who’ve made it to the top of the game. There are also players who’ve failed in Dota, but have succeeded in other games, as long as they’ve learned something from their experiences.

As for me, I have a personal bias against Dota in general. Despite this, I’ve watched all of the games of this year’s International in the most recent days, and I’ve watched the Dota 2 finals in person. There are just a few things I love about Dota, and some things I dislike.
